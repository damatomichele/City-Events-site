# City-Events-site
University project for course of web and mobile making and design
Made with the following technologies: 
- Program editing: Sublime Text
- FTP manger: Filezilla
- Graphics: CSS3 & Bootstrap
- Logic of the site: Javscript
-Database: non relational and realtime database (Firebase)
- Social: Facebook API

This is my first project with Bootstrap and Firebase, hoping I can make better sites with these in the future. 
Attending various comments, Enjoy! :)
